v0.7.1		- 2011-02-18
[Update]:   The UnitOfWork.Query, QueryAs, QueryAsJson methods, taking an ordinary expression is now called Where, WhereAs, WhereAsJson, since the Query overload taking an IQueryCommand got blured/tangled with the one taking an expression.
[Update]:   SisoDatabase has been replaced with SisoDbFactory.CreateDatabase

[New]:      DeleteByQuery - You can now delete other than single item by Id and instead pass a query and delete all items matching that query.
