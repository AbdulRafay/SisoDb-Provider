C=New features
D=Fixes

v0.9.0.0	- 2011-03-06
[New]:		If a Structure contains another Structure (one with an Id) it will not be serialized and indexed since this structure should be stored on it's own.

v0.8.5		- 2011-03-01
[New]:		UnitOfWork now supports Json inserts via: InsertJson, InsertManyJson. NOTE! If you have instances of an entity, it's more effective to pass it in instead of raw json.

v0.8.4		- 2011-02-28
[New]:		You can now use Database.UpdateStructureSet<TOld, TNew> with completly different types to go from lets say, SalesPerson to SalesMen and a also remap properties.

v0.8.3		- 2011-02-27
[New]:		Now uses Sequential GUIDs to boost performance.

v0.8.2		- 2011-02-27
[New]:		UnitOfWork now offers the simplified Where methods again.
[Update]:	UpdateStructureSet - Better performance by deleting by id-range and not per id. [Update]: set nocount on.

v0.8.1.0	- 2011-02-27
[New]:		Database.UpdateStructureSet (uses SqlStructureSetUpdater under the hood), which lets you pass in oldmodeldefinition and a new modeldefinition and then you can map new propertynames etc. Changes are performed within a transaction.

v0.8.0.0	- 2011-02-25
[Fixed]:	IMPORTANT! Identities where not being preserved when issuing an update.
[Removed]:	IMPORTANT! The UnitOfWork Where methods has been removed. You will have to use the Query API instead. E.g uow.Where<T>(expression) now becomes uow.Query<T>(q => q.Where(expression))
[New]:		You can now Include firstlevel single child structures in the same resultset from the database so that you don't have to do multiple queries/roundtrips. You can do this via the GetAll and Query methods using the command builder's IncludeMethod. NamedQueries works to. Return several fields with Json, where the first one should be named "Json". After that, alias should be the name of the property in the root structure.

v0.7.1.1	- 2011-02-19
[New]:		Lambda expressions for querying now supports nullable types.

v0.7.1.0	- 2011-02-18
[Update]:   The UnitOfWork.Query, QueryAs, QueryAsJson methods, taking an ordinary expression is now called Where, WhereAs, WhereAsJson, since the Query overload taking an IQueryCommand got blured/tangled with the one taking an expression.
[Update]:   SisoDatabase has been replaced with SisoDbFactory.CreateDatabase

v0.7.0.1	- 2011-02-11
[Fixed]:    bug of not being able to use lambdas with complex types.

v0.7		- 2011-02-10
[Fixed]:    You can now query Id'values using Lambdas, since it's now translated to StructureId as the column is named in Indexes-table.
[Update]:   DeleteById doesn't return bool anymore.
[New]:      DeleteByQuery - You can now delete other than single item by Id and instead pass a query and delete all items matching that query.
[New]:      Now able to specify sorting when querying using: Query, QueryAs, QueryAsJson, GetAll, GetAllAs, GetAllAsJson
