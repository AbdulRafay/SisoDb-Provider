v0.7 - 2011-02-10

- Bug: You can now query Id'values using Lambdas, since it's now translated to StructureId as the column is named in Indexes-table.
- Update: DeleteById doesn't return bool anymore.
- Feature: DeleteByQuery - You can now delete other than single item by Id and instead pass a query and delete all items matching that query.
- Feature: Now able to specify sorting when querying using: Query, QueryAs, QueryAsJson, GetAll, GetAllAs, GetAllAsJson
