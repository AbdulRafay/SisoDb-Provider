# SisoDb - Simple-Structure-Oriented-Db - a document-oriented db-provider for SQL-Server.

By using SisoDb you get to store and retrieve complete POCO-graphs without having to specify:

* any mappings
* or extending any interfaces 
* or extending any base-classes

_there's also no proxies_ etc. **It's just storage of your entities made simple**.

## NuGet
SisoDb is available via NuGet: http://nuget.org/List/Packages/SisoDb.Sql2008

NOTE! The old package (SisoDb) will be left for a while but from v3.0 specific provider packages exists.

or simply just run:

### PM> Install-Package SisoDb.Sql2008
