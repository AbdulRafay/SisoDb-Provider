# SisoDb - Simple-Structure-Oriented-Db - A NoSQL'ish implementation for SQL-Server.

By using SisoDb you get to store and retrieve complete POCO-graphs without having to specify:

* any mappings
* or extending any interfaces 
* or extending any base-classes

_there's also no proxies_ etc. **It's just storage of your entities made simple**.
